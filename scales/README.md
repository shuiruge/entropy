# scales

In this folder, we study the scaling laws in machine learning.

The scaling laws (power laws) found in language models also appear in many aspects of nature (e.g. West 1997). In this folder, we explore the scaling laws by using much smaller model on much smaller dataset. This _aplysia_ in machine learning enable us make faster experiments and simply the research.

## Utils

We use a simple experiment manager to log the experiments. You can download the (single) file by

```sh
wget https://github.com/shuiruge/xmanager/blob/main/xmanager.py
```

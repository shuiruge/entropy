# fractal

## Description

This directory involves notebooks that explore the fractal structures in nature and try to explain how they emerge.

## Notebooks

- Fractal in Biology: This notebook discuss the fractal struture in mammalian vessel system. We make experiments that explore the hyper-parameters that affect the optimized structure. From these experiments, we find the mathematical structure from which fractal emerges.
- Fractal in Biology (West 1997): We apply the analysis to discuss the result given by West, et al. (1997).
- Fractal in Logistics System: We apply the analysis to logistics system in city, just for fun.

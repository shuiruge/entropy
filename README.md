# maxent

Notes about maximum-entropy (MaxEnt) principle.

## TODO

- [ ] Explain [relative entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) as the relative surprise.
- [ ] Prove that there exists solutions for the Langrangian multipliers.
- [x] Derive Fokker-Planck equation from master equation; and prove that conservative Langevin dynamics satisfies detailed balance.
- [ ] Compute MaxEnt with relative entropy.
